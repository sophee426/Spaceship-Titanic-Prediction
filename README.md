# Spaceship Titanic Data Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains Python code for data analysis and predictive modeling of the Spaceship Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system and includes the following fields:

- PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- HomePlanet: The planet the passenger departed from.
- CryoSleep: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the voyage.
- Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger is staying.
- Destination: The planet the passenger will debark to.
- Age: The age of the passenger.
- VIP: Whether the passenger has paid for VIP service.
- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: Amount billed at various amenities.
- Name: The passenger's name.
- Transported: The target variable indicating if the passenger was transported to another dimension.
